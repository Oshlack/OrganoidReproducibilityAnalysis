# OrganoidVarAnalysis

# Introduction
This repository contains the R scripts and count data for our paper titled "Transcriptional evaluation of variability between human pluripotent stem cell derived kidney organoids". The R scripts contain all the analysis and code required to reproduce the figures and tables in the paper.

For all RNA-seq analyses, the Data folder contains the summarised count data and sample information. For the single cell RNA-seq analysis, we assume that the data has been downloaded from GEO and processed using cellranger. The R script starts by reading in the cellranger output files.

The GEO accession codes for all the raw data are: GSE88942, GSE70101, GSE89044, GSE99468, GSE99469, GSE99582, GSE107305, GSE107230, GSE108291, GSE88942 and GSE114802.
